# gimatria
A .Net class library for calculating the Gimatria (Gematria / Gematriya) value of strings of Hebrew text, or convert numbers into Hebrew Text.

Gematria is a traditional Jewish system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase (Wikipedia)

This Gimatira class has two functions in it:
1. Convert Hebrew letters to number - "HebrewToNum".
2. Convert number to Hebrew letters - "NumToHebrew".

It has a very good "Text Cleaner" that removes all unrelevant characretrs, and translate all unicode Hebrew spacial characters to it's equivalant letter. This assures an accurate result.
