# gimatria
This Gimatira class has two functions in it:
1. Convert Hebrew letters to number - "HebrewToNum".
2. Convert number to Hebrew letters - "NumToHebrew".

It has a very good "Text Cleaner" that removes all unrelevant characretrs, and translate all unicode Hebrew spacial characters to it's equivalant letter.
